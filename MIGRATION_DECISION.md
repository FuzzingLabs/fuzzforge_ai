# FuzzForge AI: Migration Decision Document

**Date:** 2025-10-01 (Updated)
**Status:** Architecture Revised - Ready for Implementation
**Decision Makers:** FuzzingLabs Team
**Recommendation:** Migrate to Temporal with Vertical Workers + MinIO

---

## üîÑ CRITICAL UPDATE (2025-10-01)

**Initial analysis was incomplete.** The original architecture document missed a critical requirement:

> **"Workflows are dynamic and have to be created without modifying the codebase"**

### What Changed

The original plan proposed "no registry needed" with long-lived workers, but failed to address how dynamic workflows with custom dependencies would work. This created a fundamental contradiction.

### Revised Architecture

**New approach: Vertical Workers + MinIO**

| Aspect | Original Plan | Revised Plan |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| **Workers** | Generic long-lived | **Vertical-specific** (Android, Rust, Web, iOS, etc.) |
| **Toolchains** | Install per workflow | **Pre-built per vertical** |
| **Workflows** | Unclear | **Mounted as volume** (no rebuild) |
| **Storage** | LocalVolumeStorage (dev) / S3 (prod) | **MinIO everywhere** (unified) |
| **Target Access** | Host filesystem mounts | **Upload to MinIO** (secure) |
| **Registry** | Eliminated | **Eliminated** (workflows in volume, not images) |
| **Services** | 1 (Temporal only) | 6 (Temporal + MinIO + 3+ vertical workers) |
| **Memory** | "~4.5GB" | **~2.3GB** (realistic calculation) |

### Key Insights

1. **Dynamic workflows ARE compatible** with long-lived workers via volume mounting
2. **Verticals solve** the toolchain problem (pre-built, no per-workflow installs)
3. **MinIO is lightweight** (256MB with CI_CD=true) and provides unified storage
4. **No registry overhead** (workflow code mounted, not built into images)
5. **Better marketing** (sell "security verticals", not "orchestration platform")

### What This Means

- ‚úÖ Migration still recommended
- ‚úÖ Timeline extended to 10 weeks (from 8)
- ‚úÖ More services but better architecture
- ‚úÖ Addresses all original pain points
- ‚úÖ Supports dynamic workflows correctly

**See ARCHITECTURE.md v2.0 for full details.**

## Executive Summary

### The Proposal

**Migrate from Prefect to Temporal** for workflow orchestration, simplifying infrastructure from 6 services to 1 while maintaining module architecture and preparing for future scale.

### Why Consider This?

Current Prefect setup has grown complex with:
- 6 services to manage (Prefect, Postgres, Redis, Registry, Docker-proxy, Worker)
- Unclear scaling path for high-volume production
- Registry overhead for module isolation
- Complex volume mounting configuration

### Key Decision Points

| Decision | Recommendation | Timeline |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Replace Prefect?** | ‚úÖ Yes - with Temporal | Now (Weeks 1-8) |
| **Worker Strategy?** | ‚úÖ Long-lived containers | Now (Weeks 3-4) |
| **Storage Strategy?** | ‚úÖ Abstract layer (Local‚ÜíS3) | Now (Week 3) |
| **Add Nomad?** | ‚è≥ Later - when 10+ hosts | 18-24 months |
| **Add Kubernetes?** | ‚ùå No - unnecessary complexity | N/A |

### Bottom Line

**Recommended:** Proceed with Temporal migration.
- **Effort:** 8 weeks, Medium complexity
- **Risk:** Low (rollback possible, modules unchanged)
- **Benefit:** 83% infrastructure reduction, clear scaling path, better reliability

## Current State Analysis

### Prefect Architecture (Current)

```
Infrastructure:
‚îú‚îÄ Prefect Server (orchestration)
‚îú‚îÄ Postgres (metadata storage)
‚îú‚îÄ Redis (task queue)
‚îú‚îÄ Docker Registry (image sharing)
‚îú‚îÄ Docker Proxy (container isolation)
‚îî‚îÄ Prefect Worker (execution)

Total: 6 services
```

### Strengths of Current Setup

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Familiarity** | ‚úÖ High | Team knows Prefect well |
| **Functionality** | ‚úÖ Good | Workflows execute successfully |
| **Module System** | ‚úÖ Excellent | BaseModule interface is solid |
| **Documentation** | ‚úÖ Good | Internal docs exist |

### Pain Points

| Issue | Impact | Frequency | Severity |
|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Infrastructure Complexity** | Managing 6 services | Continuous | High |
| **Registry Overhead** | Push/pull for every deployment | Every change | Medium |
| **Unclear Scaling** | How to go multi-host? | Future planning | High |
| **Resource Usage** | ~8GB under load | Continuous | Medium |
| **Volume Mounting** | Complex job_variables config | Every workflow | Medium |

### Why Change Now?

1. **Planning for Scale:** Need clear path from 1 host ‚Üí multi-host ‚Üí cluster
2. **Infrastructure Debt:** 6 services growing harder to maintain
3. **Better Options Available:** Temporal provides simpler, more scalable solution

   - vs ~76GB for ephemeral approach
   - 10-20√ó better resource utilization

3. **Predictable Performance**
   - Consistent response times
   - No container startup jitter
   - Better SLA capability

4. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Add more workers linearly
   - Each worker handles N concurrent
   - Clear capacity planning

5. **Production-Ready**
   - Proven pattern (Uber, Airbnb)
   - Handles thousands of workflows/day
   - Industry standard for scale

#### ‚ùå Against

1. **Volume Mounting Complexity**
   - Must mount parent directories
   - Or implement S3 storage backend
   - More sophisticated configuration

2. **Shared Container State**
   - Workers reused across workflows
   - Potential for subtle bugs
   - Requires careful module design

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - Must handle worker restarts
   - Graceful shutdown needed
   - More complex monitoring

4. **Memory Management**
   - Workers accumulate memory over time
   - Need periodic restarts
   - Requires memory limits

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Ephemeral | Long-Lived | Winner |
|----------|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Development** | ‚úÖ Simpler | ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex | Ephemeral |
| **Low Volume (<10/hour)** | ‚úÖ Acceptable | ‚úÖ Overkill | Ephemeral |
| **Medium Volume (10-100/hour)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Wasteful | ‚úÖ Efficient | Long-Lived |
| **High Volume (>100/hour)** | ‚ùå Unusable | ‚úÖ Required | Long-Lived |
| **Production Scale** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | Long-Lived |

**Recommendation:** Long-lived workers for production deployment.

**Compromise:** Can start with ephemeral for Phase 1 (proof of concept), migrate to long-lived for Phase 2 (production).

## Licensing Considerations

### Overview

**Critical Context:** FuzzForge is a **generic platform** where modules and workflows "could be anything" - not limited to fuzzing or security analysis. This significantly impacts the licensing assessment, particularly for Nomad's Business Source License.

### Temporal Licensing: ‚úÖ SAFE

**License:** MIT License

**Status:** Fully open source, zero restrictions

**Commercial Use:**
- ‚úÖ Use in production
- ‚úÖ Sell services built on Temporal
- ‚úÖ Modify source code
- ‚úÖ Redistribute
- ‚úÖ Sublicense
- ‚úÖ Private use

**Conclusion:** Temporal has **no licensing concerns** for any use case. You can build any type of platform (fuzzing, security, generic workflows, orchestration-as-a-service) without legal risk.

### Nomad Licensing: ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES CAREFUL EVALUATION

**License:** Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)

**Status:** Source-available but with restrictions

#### BSL 1.1 Key Terms

**Change Date:** 4 years after each version release
**Change License:** Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL 2.0)

**After 4 years:** Each version becomes fully open source under MPL 2.0

#### The Critical Restriction

```
Additional Use Grant:
You may make use of the Licensed Work, provided that you do not use
the Licensed Work for a Competitive Offering.

A "Competitive Offering" is a commercial product or service that is:
1. Substantially similar to the capabilities of the Licensed Work
2. Offered to third parties on a paid or free basis
```

#### What This Means for FuzzForge

**The licensing risk depends on how FuzzForge is marketed and positioned:**

##### ‚úÖ LIKELY SAFE: Specific Use Case Platform

If FuzzForge is marketed as a **specialized platform** for specific domains:

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "FuzzForge - Security Analysis Platform"
- ‚úÖ "FuzzForge - Automated Fuzzing Service"
- ‚úÖ "FuzzForge - Code Analysis Tooling"
- ‚úÖ "FuzzForge - Vulnerability Assessment Platform"

**Why Safe:**
- Nomad is used **internally** for infrastructure
- Customer is buying **fuzzing/security services**, not orchestration
- Platform's value is the **domain expertise**, not the scheduler
- Not competing with HashiCorp's offerings

##### ‚ö†Ô∏è GRAY AREA: Generic Workflow Platform

If FuzzForge pivots to emphasize **generic workflow capabilities**:

**Examples:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "FuzzForge - Workflow Orchestration Platform"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "FuzzForge - Run any containerized workload"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "FuzzForge - Generic task scheduler"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Marketing that emphasizes "powered by Nomad"

**Why Risky:**
- Could be seen as competing with Nomad Enterprise
- Offering similar capabilities to HashiCorp's products
- Customer might use it as Nomad replacement

##### ‚ùå CLEARLY VIOLATES: Orchestration-as-a-Service

If FuzzForge becomes primarily an **orchestration product**:

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå "FuzzForge Orchestrator - Schedule any workload"
- ‚ùå "Nomad-as-a-Service powered by FuzzForge"
- ‚ùå "Generic container orchestration platform"
- ‚ùå Reselling Nomad capabilities with thin wrapper

**Why Violation:**
- Directly competing with HashiCorp Nomad offerings
- "Substantially similar" to Nomad's capabilities
- Commercial offering of orchestration

#### Real-World Precedents

**HashiCorp has NOT** (as of 2025) aggressively enforced BSL against companies using their tools internally. The restriction targets:
- Cloud providers offering "managed Nomad" services
- Companies building Nomad competitors
- Vendors reselling HashiCorp functionality

**NOT targeting:**
- Companies using Nomad for internal infrastructure
- SaaS platforms that happen to use Nomad
- Domain-specific platforms (like FuzzForge's security focus)

#### Decision Tree: Should I Use Nomad?

#### FuzzForge Current Position

**Current Positioning:** Domain-specific security/analysis platform
**Nomad Usage:** Internal infrastructure (not customer-facing)
**Risk Level:** **LOW** (likely safe)

**However**, user stated: _"modules and workflows could be anything"_ - this suggests potential future expansion beyond security domain.

**If FuzzForge pivots to generic platform:**
- Risk increases from LOW ‚Üí MEDIUM
- Need legal review before Phase 3 (Nomad migration)
- Consider Kubernetes as alternative

---

### Kubernetes Licensing: ‚úÖ SAFE

**License:** Apache License 2.0

**Status:** Fully open source, zero restrictions

**Commercial Use:**
- ‚úÖ Use in production
- ‚úÖ Sell services built on Kubernetes
- ‚úÖ Modify source code
- ‚úÖ Offer managed Kubernetes (AWS EKS, GCP GKE do this)
- ‚úÖ Build competitive offerings

**Conclusion:** Kubernetes has **no licensing concerns** whatsoever, even for orchestration-as-a-service offerings.

---

### Docker Licensing: ‚úÖ SAFE

**License:** Apache License 2.0

**Status:** Fully open source

**Note:** Docker Desktop has separate commercial licensing requirements for organizations >250 employees or >$10M revenue, but Docker Engine (which FuzzForge uses) remains free for all uses.

---

### Licensing Recommendation Matrix

| Component | License | FuzzForge Risk | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Temporal** | MIT | ‚úÖ None | Use freely |
| **Docker Engine** | Apache 2.0 | ‚úÖ None | Use freely |
| **Nomad** | BSL 1.1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low-Medium | Safe if domain-specific |
| **Kubernetes** | Apache 2.0 | ‚úÖ None | Safe alternative to Nomad |

---

### Recommendations by Phase

#### Phase 1 & 2: Temporal + Docker Compose

**Licenses:** MIT (Temporal) + Apache 2.0 (Docker)
**Risk:** ‚úÖ **ZERO** - Fully safe for any use case

**Action:** Proceed without legal review required

---

#### Phase 3: Adding Nomad (18+ months)

**License:** BSL 1.1
**Risk:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW-MEDIUM** - Depends on positioning

**Action Required BEFORE Migration:**

1. **Clarify Product Positioning**
   - Will FuzzForge market as generic platform?
   - Or remain domain-specific (security/fuzzing)?

2. **Legal Review** (Recommended)
   - Consult IP lawyer familiar with BSL
   - Show marketing materials, website copy
   - Get written opinion on BSL compliance
   - Cost: $2,000-5,000 (one-time)

3. **Decision Point:**
   ```
   IF positioning = domain-specific (security/fuzzing)
   THEN proceed with Nomad (low risk)

   ELSE IF positioning = generic platform
   THEN consider Kubernetes instead (zero risk)
   ```

---

#### Alternative: Use Kubernetes Instead of Nomad

**If concerned about Nomad BSL risk:**

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Zero licensing risk (Apache 2.0)
- ‚úÖ Can offer orchestration-as-a-service freely
- ‚úÖ Larger ecosystem and community
- ‚úÖ Managed offerings on all clouds

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Higher operational complexity than Nomad
- ‚ùå Overkill for batch workload use case
- ‚ùå Steeper learning curve

**When to Choose K8s Over Nomad:**
- Planning to market as generic platform
- Uncomfortable with BSL restrictions
- Need absolute licensing certainty
- Have K8s expertise already

---

### Licensing Risk Summary

| Scenario | Temporal | Docker | Nomad | Kubernetes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|------------|
| **Security platform (current)** | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚úÖ Safe |
| **Generic workflow platform** | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky | ‚úÖ Safe |
| **Orchestration-as-a-service** | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚úÖ Safe | ‚ùå Violation | ‚úÖ Safe |

---

### Key Takeaways

1. **Temporal is completely safe** - MIT license has zero restrictions for any use case

2. **Nomad's BSL depends on positioning**:
   - ‚úÖ Safe for domain-specific platforms (security, fuzzing)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky for generic workflow platforms
   - ‚ùå Violation for orchestration-as-a-service

3. **User's statement matters**: _"modules could be anything"_ suggests generic platform potential ‚Üí increases Nomad risk

4. **Mitigation strategies**:
   - Keep marketing focused on domain expertise
   - Get legal review before Phase 3 (Nomad)
   - Alternative: Use Kubernetes (Apache 2.0) instead

5. **Decision timing**: No urgency - Nomad decision is 18+ months away (Phase 3)

6. **Recommended approach**:
   ```
   Now ‚Üí Phase 1-2:    Temporal + Docker Compose (zero risk)
   18 months ‚Üí Phase 3: Re-evaluate positioning
                        ‚Üí Domain-specific? Use Nomad
                        ‚Üí Generic platform? Use Kubernetes
   ```

- ‚è≥ Continue scaling horizontally

### Decision Criteria

**Proceed with Migration if:**
- ‚úÖ Team agrees on benefits (CHECK)
- ‚úÖ 8-week timeline acceptable (CHECK)
- ‚úÖ Resources available (CHECK)
- ‚úÖ Risk profile acceptable (CHECK)

**Defer Migration if:**
- ‚ùå Critical features launching soon (DEPENDS)
- ‚ùå Team capacity constrained (DEPENDS)
- ‚ùå Major Prefect improvements announced (UNLIKELY)

### Alternative: Start Smaller

**If full migration seems risky:**

1. **Proof of Concept (2 weeks)**
   - Migrate one simple workflow
   - Validate Temporal locally
   - Assess complexity
   - Decision point: Continue or abort

2. **Parallel Run (4 weeks)**
