# Understanding Workflows in FuzzForge

Workflows are the backbone of FuzzForge’s security analysis platform. If you want to get the most out of FuzzForge, it’s essential to understand what workflows are, how they’re designed, and how they operate from start to finish. This page explains the core concepts, design principles, and execution models behind FuzzForge workflows—so you can use them confidently and effectively.

## What Is a Workflow?

A **workflow** in FuzzForge is a containerized process that orchestrates one or more security tools to analyze a target codebase or application. Each workflow is tailored for a specific type of security analysis (like static analysis, secret detection, or fuzzing) and is designed to be:

- **Isolated:** Runs in its own Docker container for security and reproducibility.
- **Integrated:** Can combine multiple tools for comprehensive results.
- **Standardized:** Always produces SARIF-compliant output.
- **Configurable:** Accepts parameters to customize analysis.
- **Scalable:** Can run in parallel and scale horizontally.

## How Does a Workflow Operate?

### High-Level Architecture

Here’s how a workflow moves through the FuzzForge system:

```mermaid
graph TB
    User[User/CLI/API] --> API[FuzzForge API]
    API --> Prefect[Prefect Orchestrator]
    Prefect --> Worker[Prefect Worker]
    Worker --> Container[Docker Container]
    Container --> Tools[Security Tools]
    Tools --> Results[SARIF Results]
    Results --> Storage[Persistent Storage]
```

**Key roles:**
- **User/CLI/API:** Submits and manages workflows.
- **FuzzForge API:** Validates, orchestrates, and tracks workflows.
- **Prefect Orchestrator:** Schedules and manages workflow execution.
- **Prefect Worker:** Runs the workflow in a Docker container.
- **Security Tools:** Perform the actual analysis.
- **Persistent Storage:** Stores results and artifacts.

## Workflow Lifecycle: From Idea to Results

1. **Design:** Choose tools, define integration logic, set up parameters, and build the Docker image.
2. **Deployment:** Build and push the image, register the workflow, and configure defaults.
3. **Execution:** User submits a workflow; parameters and target are validated; the workflow is scheduled and executed in a container; tools run as designed.
4. **Completion:** Results are collected, normalized, and stored; status is updated; temporary resources are cleaned up; results are made available via API/CLI.

## Types of Workflows

FuzzForge supports several workflow types, each optimized for a specific security need:

- **Static Analysis:** Examines source code without running it (e.g., Semgrep, Bandit).
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Tests running applications for runtime vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Nuclei).
- **Secret Detection:** Finds exposed credentials and sensitive data (e.g., TruffleHog, Gitleaks).
- **Infrastructure Analysis:** Checks infrastructure-as-code and configs for misconfigurations (e.g., Checkov, Hadolint).
- **Fuzzing:** Generates unexpected inputs to find crashes and edge cases (e.g., AFL++, libFuzzer).
- **Comprehensive Assessment:** Combines multiple analysis types for full coverage.

## Workflow Design Principles

- **Tool Agnostic:** Workflows abstract away the specifics of underlying tools, providing a consistent interface.
- **Fail-Safe Execution:** If one tool fails, others continue—partial results are still valuable.
- **Configurable:** Users can adjust parameters to control tool behavior, output, and execution.
- **Resource-Aware:** Workflows specify and respect resource limits (CPU, memory).
- **Standardized Output:** All results are normalized to SARIF for easy integration and reporting.

---

## Execution Models

- **Synchronous:** Wait for the workflow to finish and get results immediately—great for interactive use.
- **Asynchronous:** Submit a workflow and check back later for results—ideal for long-running or batch jobs.
- **Parallel:** Run multiple workflows at once for comprehensive or time-sensitive analysis.

---

## Data Flow and Storage

- **Input:** Target code and parameters are validated and mounted as read-only volumes.
- **Processing:** Tools are initialized and run (often in parallel); outputs are collected and normalized.
- **Output:** Results are stored in persistent volumes and indexed for fast retrieval; metadata is saved in the database; intermediate results may be cached for performance.

---

## Error Handling and Recovery

- **Tool-Level:** Timeouts, resource exhaustion, and crashes are handled gracefully; failed tools don’t stop the workflow.
- **Workflow-Level:** Container failures, volume issues, and network problems are detected and reported.
- **Recovery:** Automatic retries for transient errors; partial results are returned when possible; workflows degrade gracefully if some tools are unavailable.

---

## Performance and Optimization

- **Container Efficiency:** Docker images are layered and cached for fast startup; containers may be reused when safe.
- **Parallel Processing:** Independent tools run concurrently to maximize CPU usage and minimize wait times.
- **Caching:** Images, dependencies, and intermediate results are cached to avoid unnecessary recomputation.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Metrics:** Track execution time, resource usage, and success/failure rates.
- **Logging:** Structured logs and tool outputs are captured for debugging and analysis.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Live status updates and progress indicators are available via API/WebSocket.

---

## Integration Patterns

- **CI/CD:** Integrate workflows into pipelines to block deployments on critical findings.
- **API:** Programmatically submit and track workflows from your own tools or scripts.
- **Event-Driven:** Use webhooks or event listeners to trigger actions on workflow completion.

## In Summary

Workflows in FuzzForge are designed to be robust, flexible, and easy to integrate into your security and development processes. By combining containerization, orchestration, and a standardized interface, FuzzForge workflows help you automate and scale security analysis—so you can focus on fixing issues, not just finding them.
